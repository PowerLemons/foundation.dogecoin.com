				<h3><b>Sponsored Initiatives</b></h3>
				<p class="postTime">Posted: 6 February 2014.</p>
				<p>In order to make a distinction between the kinds of initiatives that we support within the Dogecoin community, and those designed to promote our brand and help the world at large, we have created a system of classification for the different types of things we do.</p>
				<p>Anything that involves payments with Dogecoin is simple to list but since the success of our first promotion for the Jamaican bobsled team, we have been inundated with suggestions for various projects and although they are all worthwhile, it would be impractical for us to run them all.</p>
				<h5><b>Ongoing Initiatives</b></h5>
				<p>These are the regular initiatives that already exist. Development bounties, listings for charities that directly accept Dogecoin donations, and anything else where the payment of a fund is a simple transfer of Dogecoins without converting them to another currency. These are the types of initiatives that anyone can suggest and have listed provided they meet the criteria laid out on our "About Us" page.</p>
				<h5><b>Sponsored Initiatives</b></h5>
				<p>These are the kinds of initiatives that promote the Dogecoin brand and community to the wider world and by necessity involve a conversion of the fund into another currency at the end of the fundraiser. The Jamaican bobsled drive is a good example of this, as is our new doge4kids project.</p>
				<p>The point of sponsored initiatives is to be a focused effort with a specific fundraising goal and end date, with a pre-defined outcome to be achieved at the end. Because of the nature of this as well as the effort involved, only one sponsored initiative will be run at a time.</p>

				<h3><b>So News! Much New.</b></h3>
				<p class="postTime">Posted: 6 February 2014.</p>
				<p>Greetings fellow shibes!</p>
				<p>Welcome to our new Foundation blog. Here you can keep up to date with all the latest Foundation news. This page is a little bare at the moment but I'd like to start maintaining weekly entries about the specifics of what we've been doing and announcing our future plans.</p>
				<p>Some of you may have noticed that there are always many plans in the works that are very slow to actually materialize. Our inbox is overflowing with unanswered emails and approved listings that still need to be set up and added to the site. The simple fact is that this has become far too big to be managed by the small team we have now, and we are looking for people to help out. If this is something you might consider doing please send your application to info@dogecoin.com. We are looking for people with some of the following skills:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Good written communication skills</li>
					<li>Basic knowledge of web development</li>
					<li>A high level of initiative and the ability to self-manage</li>
					<li>Enthusiasm for promoting the Dogecoin brand</li>
					<li>Any additional skills you have that you think would benefit the Foundation</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If any of this sounds like you then we look forward to hearing from you.</p>
