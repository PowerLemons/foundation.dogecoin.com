				<h2>What is dogecoin?</h2>
				<p>Dogecoin is a new form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a> similar to bitcoin that was created in late 2013.</p>
				<h2>How do I get started using dogecoin?</h2>
				<p>Simply head over to <a href="http://www.dogecoin.com">dogecoin.com</a> and download the free wallet app to start being able to send and receive dogecoin. There you will also find many links containing information about the coin and community.</p>
				<h2>Will dogecoin make me rich?</h2>
				<p>No. If you hoard all the coins you have in the hope that the value will increase and you will get rich quick you'll be both disappointed, and hurting dogecoin.</p>
				<p>The point of any currency is to exchange it for goods and services so making a pile and hiding it in a secret lair is no good to anyone. We hope that through this foundation we can encourage the growth and use of dogecoin as the premier currency of the internet, rather than it existing as a fiat equivalent commodity.</p>
				<h2>So what's the deal with this foundation then?</h2>
				<p>The Dogecoin Foundation was created to promote use of the currency through a combination of goodwill and charitable endeavors, and providing incentives to those with the skills to improve the experience of using the coin.</p>
				<p>The members of the dogecoin community have proven themselves time and time again to be a wonderful and generous bunch of people. From assisting new shibes getting set up to banding together to help victims of dishonest opportunists, they have always been forthcoming with aid. We aim to foster that environment by providing a trustworthy and transparent service in order to serve the dogecoin community to the best of our ability.</p>
				<h2>Who made the Dogecoin Foundation? Who runs it?</h2>
				<p>The Dogecoin Foundation was conceived by the original creators of dogecoin, BillyM2K (Billy Markus) and ummjackson (Jackson Palmer). The running of the foundation is open to input and management from all members of the core dogecoin team, co-ordinated by the foundation team leader.</p>
