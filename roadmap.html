						  <p>In late January 2014, the Dogecoin community raised 4 million DOGE for the Indian athletes competing in the Sochi Olympics. Despite the lightning fast time in which the money was raised and with no prior evidence that it wouldn't be needed, the Indian Ministry for Sports stepped in to pay for their althetes and the funds were no longer required.</p>
						  <p>Rather than accept the money, the beneficiaries generously forwarded to the Doges 4 Kids initiative so that it could still be used for a great cause. You can read a statement from them at <a>http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1wwt0s/thank_you_to_the_dogecoin_community/</a>.</p>
